Course Topics
  Anonymity, Privacy, Darkweb, Security

1. TOR BROWSER
   3 nodes then to the website Or 2 nodes and then to onion service
   Use https in windows for incoming and outgoing requests from TOR network
   Hence better to use TOR Browser

   TOR Browser is modified Firefox ESR
   Disable all scripts and forces HTTPS
   https://www.torproject.org/download/languages - Download link
   Verify the download for sure by signature using gpg4win using cmd commands available on website
   Don't maximise TOR browser for safety
   https://check.torproject.org - to check used IP address
 
   A. If TOR is blocked by ISP, use TOR bridge - first node that is publically not available.  https://bridges.torproject.org/options or mail to bridges@torproject.org or frontdesk@torproject.org
   Go to tor network settings in tor browser, tor is censored and provide the bridge
   B. If Deep package filtering is done by ISP, use pluggable transport - makes traffic normal and not like TOR traffic
   C. We can use VPN to hide us from ISP, to bypass censorship and provide privacy, anonymity and encryption prevents from hackers
   
   Browser Settings-
   tor browser -> options
   A. Never remembers history
   B. Tracking Protection - always
   C. Block pop-up, add-ons and prevent accessibility services
   D. Block dangerous and deceptive content - both checkbox
   tor browser -> 🛡️ -> Advanced Security Settings

2. INTRODUCTION TO TAILS-
   Download links
   https://tails.boum.org/install/win/usb-download/index.en.html
   https://www.balena.io/etcher/
   Flash it in a USB
   
   Open Tails
   We can add a bridge from additional settings -> network configuration in login screen in Tails. Configure it, save the bridge.
   Ctrl+Alt+down/up or by Windows button - To switch Workspaces
   Use Persistence on Tails to save files and data. Applications - > Tails -> Persistence Storage. Turn Network Settings, Tor Browser,   Bitcoin Client, Personal Data, GnupG, Thunderbird and Pidgen
   A Persistent Folder will be created in Places
   Tor browser will have access to only Tor Browser and Tor Browser Persistent folders
   Use Unsafe browser to connect to captive portal that require authentication to connect to internet. After Authenticating to cafe page, We can switch to Tor Browser
   Tails forces all network to go through tor network, hence we need to set up VPN to use it. So redirect the firewall to VPN

   B) USING INSTANT MESSAGING
   https://gist.github.com/dllud/a46d4a555e31dfeff6ad41dcf20729ac  OR in my files it is saved - XMPP HIDDEN SERVICES
   dismail.de is a good one to use
   
   Pidgen is inbuilt - used for XMPP
   Add an account in Pidgen as XMPP, domain - dismail.de. Login to dismail.de account
   Add a buddy
   Add onion dismail.de service in Pidgen by modifying in Advanced tab. This will not leave tor network and will connect to inside XMPP
   Enable end-to-end communication by OTR(of the recoed) plugin so that XMPP server may not read our message
   To enable OTR, go to Pidgen -> login the account -> Tools -> Plugins -> OTR -> check out the checkbox for private message. Then Click Not Private Button in chat
   Verify Contacts. The Butto is Unverified currently. Click on it and authenticate buddy. Button changes to Private
