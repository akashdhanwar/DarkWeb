Course Topics
  Anonymity, Privacy, Darkweb, Security

1. TOR BROWSER
   3 nodes then to the website Or 2 nodes and then to onion service
   Use https in windows for incoming and outgoing requests from TOR network
   Hence better to use TOR Browser

   TOR Browser is modified Firefox ESR
   Disable all scripts and forces HTTPS
   https://www.torproject.org/download/languages - Download link
   Verify the download for sure by signature using gpg4win using cmd commands available on website
   Don't maximise TOR browser for safety
   https://check.torproject.org - to check used IP address
 
   A. If TOR is blocked by ISP, use TOR bridge - first node that is publically not available.  https://bridges.torproject.org/options or mail to bridges@torproject.org or frontdesk@torproject.org
   Go to tor network settings in tor browser, tor is censored and provide the bridge
   B. If Deep package filtering is done by ISP, use pluggable transport - makes traffic normal and not like TOR traffic
   C. We can use VPN to hide us from ISP, to bypass censorship and provide privacy, anonymity and encryption prevents from hackers
   
   Browser Settings-
   tor browser -> options
   A. Never remembers history
   B. Tracking Protection - always
   C. Block pop-up, add-ons and prevent accessibility services
   D. Block dangerous and deceptive content - both checkbox
   tor browser -> 🛡️ -> Advanced Security Settings
   E. Standard, Safer and Safest select. https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/ - test browser safety. must be less than 33bits
   

2. INTRODUCTION TO TAILS-
   Download links
   https://tails.boum.org/install/win/usb-download/index.en.html
   https://www.balena.io/etcher/
   Flash it in a USB
   
   Open Tails
   We can add a bridge from additional settings -> network configuration in login screen in Tails. Configure it, save the bridge.
   Ctrl+Alt+down/up or by Windows button - To switch Workspaces
   Use Persistence on Tails to save files and data. Applications - > Tails -> Persistence Storage. Turn Network Settings, Tor Browser,   Bitcoin Client, Personal Data, GnupG, Thunderbird and Pidgen
   A Persistent Folder will be created in Places
   Tor browser will have access to only Tor Browser and Tor Browser Persistent folders
   Use Unsafe browser to connect to captive portal that require authentication to connect to internet. After Authenticating to cafe page, We can switch to Tor Browser
   Tails forces all network to go through tor network, hence we need to set up VPN to use it. So redirect the firewall to VPN

   Full list (keep in mind links might not work, if they don't then look for the service name in search engines or in link directories)
   https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/6krt34/list_of_onion_email_providers/
   
   Which email provider to Select?
   Find the image to know.
   
   B) USING INSTANT MESSAGING
   https://gist.github.com/dllud/a46d4a555e31dfeff6ad41dcf20729ac  OR in my files it is saved - XMPP HIDDEN SERVICES
   dismail.de is a good one to use
   
   Pidgen is inbuilt - used for XMPP
   Add an account in Pidgen as XMPP, domain - dismail.de. Login to dismail.de account
   Add a buddy
   Add onion dismail.de service in Pidgen by modifying in Advanced tab. This will not leave tor network and will connect to inside XMPP
   Enable end-to-end communication by OTR(of the recoed) plugin so that XMPP server may not read our message
   To enable OTR, go to Pidgen -> login the account -> Tools -> Plugins -> OTR -> check out the checkbox for private message. Then Click Not Private Button in chat
   Verify Contacts. The Butto is Unverified currently. Click on it and authenticate buddy. Button changes to Private
   
   C) FILE SHARING-
   Metadata reveals many info about file, so remove metadata
   Right click, clear metadata in Tails
   send.firefox.com - creates a key at client side which can be seen in url, but link is not safe. Works in standard setting since it use javascript
   Hence we should use peer-to-peer transfer an end-to-end encryption. Use tool OnionShare for this. It will create a onion service on my computer so that others can use it
   Right click on file -> Share via OnionShare. Share the link with other person
   Also, Remove files securely. Files are not completely deleted on deleting until overwritten
   Go to file -> Right click -> move to trash. Delete from  trash. But we should Wipe it OR go to folder -> right click and Wipe (Only for Harddisk)
   For SSD and USB, format and wipe it. 
   Applications -> Utilities -> Disk utilities -> Format by Overwrite data and we can encrypt it by providing phrase. The Drive will be encrypted
   
   D) ENCRYPTION-
   Using PGP(Pretty Good Encryption) - Encrypts Email, Text or Files. Unbroken. Asymmetric approach
   Symmetric Encryption - same key used for encrypt and decrypt
   Asymmetric Encryption - different keys are used. Reciever generate both keys, send public key to the sender and keeps the private key
   Creating keys - click on clipboard on top right and select manage keys OR in applications > Utilities > Password and keys > gnupg keys > Click on + sign > PGP key > name and email(permanent) > Advanced RSA(Optional) > Set passphrase
   Sharing Keys - Export only public key. Password and Keys > File > Export to Tor Browser. We can change format of file from pgp to asc to view content. Then we can share it in any way
   Importing keys - Password and Keys > File > Import 
   Adding the key to message - create a file, select text and click on clipboard on top right. Sign/Encrypt with public key, select the key. If we also want to see the code after encryption, then add your own key and select that also
                               After encrypting paste the encrypted text by ctrl+v
   Decryption - Copy the text, click on clipboard on top right and decrypt using passphrase

   Digital Signatures - The problem with encryption is that anyone can send the message using public key pretending to be someone
   When the sender is sending message using recievers public key, he also attaches his own private key as a signature, Reciever will verify signature by senders public key
   Signing message and Verifying signature - Select private key for signing from dropdown. Check if signature is good signature on recievers end.
   
   Signing Files, Verify and Decrypt Files - Ex- image. Right click and encrypt.
   We can also create a signature separately and verify as we verified tor browser (.sig file). Send both files, normal file and sig
   On Recievers end right click .sig and verify signature

   Using key servers - For sharing keys. Dont upload with personal information
   Go to Passwork and keys > Edit > Preferences > publish keys to. Then go to Remote > Sync and Publish keys. Reciever will go to Remote > Find remote keys. search by anything like email, then import
   Note that confirm that the fingerprint and id belongs to correct person by email


   E) CRYPTOCURRENCIES-
   Used for Send/Recieve money anonymously
   Create a crypto wallet, sign coin with his private key and add a public key also to be identified
   Then Sender will send the message to cryptocurrency network(many computers called miners/blockchain)

   Bitcoin - 
   Create a wallet i.e. a software Ex- electrum. https://electrum.org/#home Download the linux image and signature. Also scoll down and download developers public key by right click and save link as
